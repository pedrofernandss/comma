# Comma

A serverless curation bot that sends a daily article about AI and technology via WhatsApp to help you stay updated and to stimulate your critical thinking in a simple and direct way.

### Why "Comma"?

The name "Comma" reflects the core philosophy of the project. In writing, a comma signifies a pause, not a full stop. It suggests that the story continues. This bot is built on the same idea: the pursuit of knowledge is a continuous journey, not a destination. There is always another article to read, another idea to explore, another connection to be made.

Never a period, always a comma.

## üéØ About The Project

In the midst of an overwhelming volume of newsletters, blogs, and news, staying up-to-date in the tech industry is a challenge. This project was born to solve this problem by delivering a single, high-quality article per day directly to WhatsApp, a personal and high-engagement channel.

The initial version was built for Discord but failed due to low adoption, teaching a valuable lesson about the importance of User Experience (UX) and the choice of delivery channel.
